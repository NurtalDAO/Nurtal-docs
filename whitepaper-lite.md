# NurtalDAO Whitepaper-Lite (v0.1)

## 1. Introduction / Vision
Biology generates vast data, yet much of it is fragmented, hard to reproduce, and locked away. AI can accelerate discovery—but only with clean, open, trustworthy data.

**NurtalDAO** is a community-owned platform for AI-powered biology. We combine curated datasets, reproducibility frameworks, and AI models in an open marketplace governed by the community—not by closed labs or corporations.

## 2. Problems We’re Solving
- **Reproducibility crisis:** a large share of studies can’t be replicated, slowing progress.
- **Protein/Imaging bottlenecks:** design & analysis are slow, costly, and unpredictable.
- **Messy data:** scattered formats + missing metadata make AI underperform.

## 3. Our Solution (Platform Layers)
- **Data Layer:** curated, standardized, AI-ready datasets (omics, imaging, protein expression).
- **Proof Layer:** reproducibility reports (PASS/FAIL + methods) published on-chain or IPFS.
- **Model Layer:** AI models trained on these datasets (protein design, cell image analysis, omics).
- **Application Layer:** simple tools researchers can actually use.
- **Marketplace:** governed access; revenue flows back to the DAO treasury.

## 4. Research Focus (initial)
Reproducibility • AI-ready datasets • Recombinant proteins • Imaging • Omics • Neuroscience.

## 5. Token (Planned): $NURTAL
- **Utility:** governance (stake → vote), access to datasets/models/tools, service payments.
- **Value flow:** marketplace fees + licensing → DAO treasury; potential burns/liquidity support.
- **Launch:** via **Bio.xyz Launchpad** on **Base** for credibility & liquidity pairing.

## 6. Roadmap (high level)
- **M0 Foundations (0–3 mo):** Safe on Base, docs live, Discord growth, first contributors.
- **M1 Launch (3–6 mo):** $NURTAL via Bio.xyz (subject to selection), governance live.
- **M2 Outputs (6–9 mo):** 1st reproducibility report + curated dataset + prototype AI module.
- **M3 Expansion (9–15 mo):** more modules, more proofs, first IP-NFT pilots.
- **M4 Marketplace (15–24 mo):** datasets/models/reports with $NURTAL payments.

## 7. Community & Governance
Start with a Safe multisig on Base (<YOUR_SAFE_ADDRESS>), move to broader DAO voting as the community grows. All changes and addresses published in Transparency.

## 8. Why Now
AI breakthroughs (e.g., protein structure prediction, general cell segmentation) show what’s possible. The missing piece is **open, reproducible, community-governed biology**. NurtalDAO fills that gap.
